# A Raspberry Pi Music Update Twitter Bot

As part of the IFB102 syllabus, a mini-project was undertaken to delve into a deeper study into computer systems technologies to investigate, design, and implement a set of different computer technologies configured for a novel purpose, in this case using a Raspberry Pi computer. For this project, a Twitter bot was created using Python which tweets a song that is either being currently played or was last played (tracked using Last.fm) and makes use of the Twitter and Last.fm API.
