# A Raspberry Pi Music Update Twitter Bot

Utilizing a Raspberry Pi backed by the knowledge obtained throughout this semester, an endeavour to create a bot to automate tweets on the Twitter social media platform was ideated. As creating such a bot would bring about the question of triviality of what would be the subject of tweeting, the bot is to be designed to tweet content obtained from an external source, both on a software and hardware level.

Music is a driving force in life. Whatever mood, whatever circumstance, however the pressures of life may stack up, music has incredibly powerful effects. With the realization of this sentiment and after some deliberation, the bot was thus designed to act as a sort of music diary; tweeting on a specified basis or time increment the music a user is listening to, or had been listening to, in that moment. This thus would require the obtaining of such information from a software source, communicating with it through the utilization of Twitter and Last.fm API keys. To apply external hardware into this project, the bot was also designed to implement an external webcam to document a picture of the user every time the bot tweets as well as an LED connected with a resistor to a breadboard which physically notifies the user every time a tweet containing a set search term is detected by the Raspberry Pi. The set search term will be ‘music’, to continuously provide content for the user to keep up with the trends in current, modern-day music.

In full: creating a music diary Twitter bot tweeting logs of what a user is or has been listening to accompanied by an image of said user, as well as a physical notifier of when a music-related tweet is detected on the Twitter platform.
